**Note that this is an ongoing re-implementation and I cannot fully reproduce the results. Suggestions and PRs are welcome!**

# Requirements
+ Python 3.6+
+ PyTorch 0.4+

# Usage
1. Download [a Tag2Pix dataset from the officical repsitory.](https://github.com/blandocs/Tag2Pix).
2. Put it on `./datasets/tag2pix`
3. Run `bash scripts/train_tag2pix_xdog.sh baseline`. The training using sketches by XDoG will run.
4. Run `bash scripts/train_tag2pix_keras.sh baseline`. The training using sketches by SketchKeras will run.
